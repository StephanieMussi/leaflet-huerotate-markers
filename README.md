# Leaflet Hue Rotate Markers
## Change colors of the Leaflet default marker without any additional library

This repository provides the <style> definition that changes the color of Leaflet markers with the following parameter:
  - hue-rotate(deg)
  - brightness(%)
  - saturate(%)

The resultant colors match the colors displayed in the map legend, which uses the names of HTML color names that are supported by all browsers (https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp).
